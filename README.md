# Convolutional-Architecture-Timeline
A repository that has Image Classification models with all major Convolutional architecture changes over the years. The idea is to build models incorporating core architecture designs/changes from Perceptron(Linear) to EfficientNet(Conv). 

### Base Architectures Implemented (List will get updated)
- [x] Perceptron
- [ ] AlexNet
- [x] VGG
- [ ] Inception
- [ ] ResNet
- [ ] DenseNet
- [ ] EfficientNet

### Datasets Used 
- MNIST
- CIFAR10
- CIFAR100
